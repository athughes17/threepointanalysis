# Three Point Analysis

This repository was meant to analyze the three pointer in comparison with offensive efficiency to give an overall overview as to why three pointers have become so prevalent in recent years.

## Statement of Intent
People often complain about the amount of three pointers shot in the modern NBA. I am sure that anyone discussing the NBA has heard that players just "chuck threes" I want to investigate why this is. Is there a statistical reason why the NBA has changed so drastically? Is it rule-based? Were offenses truly better? I want to investigate if the game has truly lost appeal, or if it has evolved to actually be better than we previously thought. To do this, I want to look at some statistics specifically looking at the amount of 3 pointers, comparing it to offensive efficiency and looking at that over time. I also believe it will be interesting to investigate how some of the best 3 point shooters have evolved over time, and comparing the highest made three pointers by season. To do this, I will perform a statistical analysis using R code and creating visualizations to demonstrate.




## Summary of Findings
The three point shot was first introduced in the 1979-1980 NBA season, and it was seen almost as a circus trick. How could a shot from so far away be worth taking compared to the dominant big men of the era getting post shots? While it may have been a gimmick when first introduced, the three pointer singlehandedly dominates the modern NBA, even leading to criticism of the shot overall.

The NBA has recently been critiqued for the large amount of three pointers that are shot in today's game, especially in comparison to how basketball was played in the 1990s. Many casual fans will assert that three pointers are shot too frequently, and that the game is worse for it. But is this opinion true, are NBA teams shooting too many threes, or have the offenses of the modern era actually evolved. 

To investigate and see if offenses have evolved, or if they have actually worsened we must first decide how to measure offense. The easiest way to see how offenses are performing would be seeing the average amount of points being scored by a team in an average game. However, this would actually be a poor way of proving this assertion. Points in a vacuum do not show an offense's capability as it has no regard for efficiency, and most importantly, pace. Pace has varied throughout NBA history, as the 70s were known for incredibly quick pace, while the early 2000s had an extremely slow pace with very few possessions relative to other seasons. Offensive rating can be used to measure overall offense, as it measures the amount of points scored per 100 possessions. This means that pace and efficiency are accounted for, because the most effective offenses will score at a high point per possession.

The change in the amount of three pointers is as drastic as people have claimed. The amount of three pointers made per NBA game is around three times as many as it was in the 1990s, which is a huge jump and would be a reason as to why people believe threes have become too common. Additionally, the increase is not limited to the amount of makes, but the amount of attempts, as about 40% of shots attempted in the 2020s are three pointers, while in the 1990s it was between 10 and 15%. Three pointers have transformed the modern NBA in this way, as they are one of the most frequent shots attempted at this point, while they were a much rarer sight in previous eras. These statistics give some backing to the argument that "all NBA players do is chuck threes," as nearly half of field goals being three pointers gives credibility to this statement.

Three pointers may have taken over the NBA as dissidents may claim, but has this actually improved or worsened the offense? Statistics would actually back the fact that the NBA has become better offensively as time has gone on. The highest offensive ratings are all from the past 7 NBA seasons, as since 2016 average offensive rating around the NBA has skyrocketed, and there has been very few decreases between each season. The highest offensive rating of all time actually belongs to the most recent season, while being one of the highest three point taking seasons of all time. So while people may believe the NBA has worsened over time, the offense has become more efficient.

One interesting point is that despite there being a huge increase in the amount of three pointers being taken, it has not actually led to a much higher percentage shooting on average. While 3 point percentage was drastically low in the 80s and part of the 90s, it has stagnated to being about 36% on average since the 2003 season. This makes sense however, as the percentages remaining the same while more threes are attempted would lead to higher points per possession, which would lead to a higher offensive rating. This could actually further the point that people believe the amount of threes increasing is unnecessary, as players have not improved their efficiency, giving the appearance that it truly is "chucking up threes."

Both three point attempts as well as offensive rating have been increasing nearly every season, and both have taken a drastic leap ever since Steph Curry's infamous 2016 unanimous MVP year. Before the 2015 championship, a common opinion among NBA media including Charles Barkley was that shooting teams could not win. Howeever, the Warriors changed that behind Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, who have both led the league in three pointers made in a season. Finding the underlying cause for the increases in offensive rating and 3 pointers attempted may be difficult, but undoubtedly they are correlated. The reason behind theses increases could be the league embracing statistics, which have always argued that three pointers are valuable, it could be because it has been introduced long enough that current NBA players grew up practicing to shoot more, it could have been the success the Warriors found behind their system, or a variety of other reasons.

While people who scorn the NBA may claim that three pointers are too common and that they have actually worsened the game, it seems that it has actually caused an evolution. Offenses are blossoming more than they ever have, and this seems to be because the three pointer has become far more common.

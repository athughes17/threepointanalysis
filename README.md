# Three Point Analysis

This repository was meant to analyze the three pointer in comparison with offensive efficiency to give an overall overview as to why three pointers have become so prevalent in recent years.

## Statement of Intent
People often complain about the amount of three pointers shot in the modern NBA. I am sure that anyone discussing the NBA has heard that players just "chuck threes" I want to investigate why this is. Is there a statistical reason why the NBA has changed so drastically? Is it rule-based? Were offenses truly better? I want to investigate if the game has truly lost appeal, or if it has evolved to actually be better than we previously thought. To do this, I want to look at some statistics specifically looking at the amount of 3 pointers, comparing it to offensive efficiency and looking at that over time. I also believe it will be interesting to investigate how some of the best 3 point shooters have evolved over time, and comparing the highest made three pointers by season. To do this, I will perform a statistical analysis using R code and creating visualizations to demonstrate.
